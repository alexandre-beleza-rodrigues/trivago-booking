# Trivago Booking
 
## Abstract
The purpose of this report will be to use the Trivago Booking Data to classify hotel bookings into a possible canceled booking, or retained booking.

This can be used to gain insight into how and why bookings are canceled. This can also be used as a model to gain a marketing advantage, by advertisement targeting those who are more likely to retain their bookings, or saving money by not targeting the bookings that are most likely to cancel their bookings.

## Results
At the end of the project, we have a model witch can predict whether a booking will be canceled or not with an accuracy of 87 % in a dataset with a distribution of 37.04 % canceled bookings and 62.96 % retained bookings. These are significant results witch can be useful for marketing towards customers, to increase booking retention, or to help a company focus on areas of improvement.
